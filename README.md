# SoundRecognition
This project contains the use of Tensorflow for detecting a particular sound using Mobile App. I have trained a custom model for a particular door bell and used it in Mobile App. I have included the doorbell in Doorbell folder. Just install the App and play that sound, App will detect that sound and icon will start blink.
